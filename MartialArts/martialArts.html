                    The Origins of Martial Arts in the UK <br /> <br />

                    <strong>Jujutsu Arrives </strong> <br />

                    On the 26th of September 1899 a British engineer, called Barton Wright,
                    returned to England after an extended period of living and working in Japan.
                    He brought with him an eighteen year old Japanese man whom he had
                    developed a friendship with, and who he believed had something special
                    to give to the British people. The Japanese youth was Yukio Tani (1881 - 1950)
                    and he was an exponent of the Japanese art of Jujutsu.
                    The combination ofBarton Wright, as entrepreneur /manager and
                    Yukio Tani, a natural showman, led the two men into touring the
                    Music Hall circuit, where Tani would challenge anyone willing
                    to wrestle with him. With the temptation of winning £1 for
                    lasting each minute, overan initial 5 minutes, or £50 for winning,
                    there was never a shortage of challengers. However, at a diminutive
                    5 feet 6 inches (1.67Mts) Tani allegedly lost only one music hall
                    match and that was to a fellow Japanese national. <br /> <br />

                    The Origins of Martial Arts in the UK (continued...) <br /> <br />

                    <strong>Kenshiro Abbe and Kyu Shin Do </strong> <br />

                    In 1955 and as a result of the LJS decision, a man, who's credentials were
                    incredible by Japanese standards let alone British ones, arrived in Britain.
                    The man was Kenshiro Abbe (1915 - 1985) and he was single handedly to have
                    more of an impact on British Martial Arts than anyone who had gone before
                    or, for that matter, after. <br /> <br />

                    Abbe Sensei was born in Tokushima province, Japan and was first introduced to
                    Martial Arts by his father, a Kendo teacher,at the age of 3.
                    Abbe Sensei learnt Sumo wrestling at school and became the regional
                    school champion. In 1931 Abbe Sensei began Judo and one year
                    later, when only 15 years old, was graded 2nd Dan. His Judo prowess
                    grew from there, becoming the Tokushima High schools champion at 16 and
                    receiving his 3rd Dan from the national Martial Arts governing body, the Butokukai. <br /> <br />

                    <b>Carlos Ray "Chuck" Norris</b><br />
                    is an American martial artist, actor, film producer, and screenwriter. <br />
                    He is a black belt in Tang Soo Do, Brazilian jiu jitsu and judo. <br />
                    After serving in the United States Air Force, Norris won many martial arts championships and
                    later founded his own discipline Chun Kuk Do. <br /> <br />
                    The style was formally founded in 1990 as Chun Kuk Do by Chuck Norris, and was originally based on Norris' Tang Soo Do training in Korea while he was in the military.

                    During his competitive fighting career, Norris began to evolve the style to make
                    it more effective and well-rounded by studying other systems such as
                    Shōtōkan, Gōjū-ryū, Shitō-ryū, American Kenpo, Enshinkaikan, Kyokushin, Judo,
                    Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Arnis, Tae Kwon Do, Tang Soo Do and Hapkido. <br />
                    Chun Kuk Do now emphasizes self defense, competition, weapons, grappling, and fitness,
                    among other things. <br />
                    Each summer the United Fighting Arts Federation (UFAF) holds a training conference
                    and the Chun Kuk Do world championship tournament in Las Vegas, Nevada. <br /> <br />

                    "My winning first place caused quite a sensation because I was so young. <br />
                    I was 12 years old, and the other two medalists were in their mid- to late twenties. <br />
                    During the awards ceremony, as I stood on the top step of the podium, I was still shorter
                    than the 2nd and 3rd place medalists. It must have been quite a sight."

                    practising diligently for a few hours. Never one to pass by an opportunity he took control
                    of our Dojo after the sad passing of his grandfather who, unfortunately, died whilst
                    practising the rarely used plastic light sabre swinging move. He impaled himself when tripping over
                    a poorly fitted crash mat. <br /> <br />

                    Born in the 1960's his mother is said to have been the one screaming in the hospital delivery room
                    when she first laid eyes on her new born son. From there Seely's fame went from strength to
                    obscurity in a matter of moments. <br /> <br />
