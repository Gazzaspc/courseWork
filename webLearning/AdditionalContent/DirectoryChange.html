  <h1>Changing Directory on Links/Images/etc</h1>
  <p>
    When you make a LINK to a file in a different directory you need to :- <br />
    <br />
    To refer to a file and drill down to a lower directory use <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;DirectoryName/FileName <br />
    <br />
    To refer to a file in a higher directory use <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;../FileName <br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Examples :- <br /> <br />
    In, for example, a directory chain of <br />
    <b>C:/MyDirectory/Coursework/MainHTML/Images/MoreImages</b> <br />
    <br />
    Lets say all your main HTML files are in C:MyDirectory/Coursework/MainHTML <br /> <br />
    When you want to refer to images stored in MoreImages you would need, for example... <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;img src="Images/MoreImages/image.jpg" &gt; <br /> <br />

    When you want to refer to images stored in CourseWork you would need, for example... <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;img src="../image.jpg" &gt; <br /> <br />

    When you want to link to a .html file stored in MyDirectory you would need, for example... <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;a href="../../index.html"&gt;Back to file&lt;/a&gt; <br /> <br />
