//Will this work ???

<section id="myCommonHeader">
  <h1>This is my common header Section</h1>
  <p>
    I would really like this to appear at the TOP of my web page <br /> <br />
    <img src="../Images/WileHelp.jpeg" width="100px" height="100px" alt="Wile E Coyote" />
    Is that a picture ?? <br />
    </p>
  </section>

//It kinda works....
//if you add the below code to the location you want your code to appear on the page...


  <OBJECT data="../CommonToPages/commonHeader.html">
    Warning: file_to_include.html could not be included.
  </OBJECT>

  <!-- NOTE...
  that the image file has ../ before the link to the file as the location Will
  start at directory CommonToPages and ..\ will send it back one directory.

  Not great though as you will need to resize <object> to be the size you need to be displayed
    otherwise scroll bars are shown.
     -->
