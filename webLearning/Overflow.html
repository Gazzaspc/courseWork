    <h1>Demo of Text Overflow</h1>
    <p>There are a few setting that can be used to control the text overflow :- <br /> <br />
      <b>overflow:visible;</b> The overflow is not clipped. It renders outside the element's box. This is default <br />
      <b>overflow:hidden;</b> The overflow is clipped, and the rest of the content will be invisible <br />
      <b>overflow:scroll;</b> The overflow is clipped, but a scroll-bar is added to see the rest of the content <br />
      <b>overflow:auto;</b> If overflow is clipped, a scroll-bar should be added to see the rest of the content <br /> <br />
      Above are the main settings but you can also have :- <br /> <br />
      <b>overflow:initial;</b> Sets this property to its default value. <br />
      <b>overflow:inherit;</b> Inherits this property from its parent element.
    </p>
