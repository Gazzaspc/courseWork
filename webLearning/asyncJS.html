            <h1>Asynchronous Javascript</h1>

            <p>
                <b>Asynchronous</b> - more than one code thread can be run at the same time. <br />
                <b>Synchronous</b> - (default) code runs as one thread and one command has to finish before the next
                one can start. <br /> <br />

                ...you can also take a look at an MDN document on
                <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous/Async_await" target="_blank">
                    async/await
                </a> (Making asynchronous programming easier with async and await). <br /> <br />

                ...and also another 
                <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous/Choosing_the_right_approach" target="_blank">
                    document</a> on (Choosing the right approach). <br />

                <br />

                The <b>async</b> keyword is used to write functions that handle asynchronous actions. <br />
                We wrap our asynchronous logic inside a function prepended with the async keyword. <br />
                Then, we invoke that function. Eg... <br /> <br />

                <b>
                    async function myFunc() { <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// Function body here <br />
                    }; <br />
                    <br />

                    myFunc();
                </b> <br /> <br />

                OR you can say... <br /> <br />

                <b>
                    const myFunc = async () => { <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// Function body here <br />
                    }; <br /> <br />

                    myFunc();
                </b> <br /> <br />

                async functions always return a promise. <br />
                This means we can use traditional promise syntax, like <b>.then() and .catch()</b>
                with our async functions. <br />
                An async function will return in one of three ways:- <br /> <br />

                <b>...</b>If there’s nothing returned from the function, it will return a promise
                with a resolved value of undefined. <br />
                <b>...</b>If there’s a non-promise value returned from the function, it will return a
                promise resolved to that value. <br />
                <b>...</b>If a promise is returned from the function, it will simply return that promise. <br /><br />

                For example... <br /> <br />

                <pre>
async function fivePromise() { 
  return 5;
}
 
fivePromise()
.then(resolvedValue => {
    console.log(resolvedValue);
  })  
// Prints 5
</pre>

                In the example above, even though we return 5 inside the function body, what’s actually
                returned when we invoke fivePromise() is a promise with a resolved value of 5. <br />

            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="divBSet divBorder">
            <p>
                    <br /> <br />
                Therefore, a promise that may be written like... <br />
                <pre>
function nativePromise(){
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      resolve('yay!');
  })
}
</pre>

                Using <b>async</b> could be written like... <br />
                <pre>
async function asyncPromise(){
  return 'yay!';
}
</pre>

                Because <br />
                <b>...</b>If there’s a non-promise value returned from the function, it will return a
                promise resolved to that value. <br /> <br />

                <hr /> <br />

                A larger example could be... <br /> <br />

                                                    <pre>
function withConstructor(num){
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    if (num === 0){
      resolve('zero');
    } else {
      resolve('not zero');
    }
  });
}

async function withAsync(num) {
  return withConstructor(num);
};


withAsync(100)
  .then((resolveValue) => {
  console.log(` withAsync(100) returned: ${resolveValue}.`);
})
<em>>//would print to the Console.log...
//withAsync(100) returned: not zero. </em>


withAsync(0)
  .then((resolveValue) => {
  console.log(` withAsync(0) returned: ${resolveValue}.`);
})
<em>//would print to the Console.log...
//withAsync(100) returned: zero. </em>

</pre>

            <h3>The 'await' operator</h3>
            <p>
                <b>async</b> functions are almost always used with the additional keyword <b>await</b> inside
                the function body. <br /> <br />

                The <span class="blueMess">await</span> keyword can only be used inside an async function. <br />
                <span class="blueMess">await</span> is an operator: it returns the resolved value of a promise. <br />
                Since promises resolve in an indeterminate amount of time, <span class="blueMess">await</span> halts, or pauses, the
                execution of our async function until a given promise is resolved. <br /> <br />

                So, for example... <br /> <br />

                Lets pretend we have a promise function (let's call it <span class="greenMess">'funcTakesTime()'</span>) that runs a
                few <b>.then()</b> commands that prints out messages as it goes
                and could take a bit of time to run. <br />
                And we call it in our <b>async</b> function... <br /> <br />

                <b>
                    async function myAsync() { <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let myTask = <span class="blueMess">await</span>
                    <span class="greenMess">funcTakesTime()</span>; <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;console.log(`All tasks have finished now.`); <br />
                    } <br /> <br />
                </b>

                When run this would display... <br /> <br />

                <b>
                    funcTakesTime Message 1 <br />
                    funcTakesTime Message 2 <br />
                    funcTakesTime Message 3 <br />
                    etc... <br />
                    All tasks have finished now.
                </b> <br /> <br />

                Because the <b><span class="blueMess">await</span></b> command will make everything stop until all
                the funcTakesTime tasks
                have completed (it makes it run synchronously). <br /> <br />

                But if we do <b>NOT</b> have the <b><span class="blueMess">await</span></b> command then the result would be... <br /> <br />

                <b>
                    All tasks have finished now. <br />
                    funcTakesTime Message 1 <br />
                    funcTakesTime Message 2 <br />
                    funcTakesTime Message 3 <br />
                    etc... <br />
                </b> <br />

                Because the removal of the <b><span class="blueMess">await</span></b> command will make everything run
                asynchronously and not wait for the other funcTakesTime tasks to 
                complete first. <br /> <br />

            <h2>Two ways of using 'await'</h2>

            <p>
                Normally I would use...eg... <br /> <br />

                                                    <pre>
async function serveDinner() {
  const vegetablePromise = await steamBroccoli();
  const starchPromise = await cookRice();
  const proteinPromise = await bakeChicken();
  const sidePromise = await cookBeans();
  console.log(`Dinner is served. We're having 
    ${vegetablePromise}, 
    ${starchPromise}, 
    ${proteinPromise}, 
    and ${sidePromise}.`);
}

</pre>
                But you could also do it like this... <br /> <br />

                                                             <pre>
async function serveDinner() {
  const vegetablePromise = steamBroccoli();
  const starchPromise = cookRice();
  const proteinPromise = bakeChicken();
  const sidePromise = cookBeans();
  console.log(`Dinner is served. We're having 
    ${await vegetablePromise}, 
    ${await starchPromise}, 
    ${await proteinPromise}, 
    and ${await sidePromise}.`);
}
</pre>
                Because the
                <b>const vegetablePromise = steamBroccoli();</b> <br />
                does not actually run the routine (steamBroccoli), it just creates an instance of it 
                and stores it as a variable (vegetablePromise) ready for when you actually 
                want to use it. <br />
                So it only runs 'steamBroccoli' when it gets to the line that calls it<br />
                <b>await vegetablePromise</b> <br /> <br />

                <em>My Comment <br />
                I think that you could combine asynchronous and synchronous running by using... <br />
                <b>await vegetablePromise</b> in one place in the program and then elsewhere just use <br />
                <b>vegetablePromise</b> without the 'await'.</em>  <br /> <br />
