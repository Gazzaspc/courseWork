    <!--Define Viewport
    Before you do anything else, you should define the width of the viewport
    in your HTML. This will ensure that your site has no horizontal scroll - the full
    site will be visible, and users will not have to zoom on mobile to see the content.-->

    <!--Include a Browser Reset
    Every browser renders content a little differently. Also, some people use out of date browsers.
    Some developers have created stylesheets to combat these issues.
    The two most widely used are Reset and Normalize.
    The difference between the two is that Reset completely eradicates all styles, while
    Normalize attempts to add consistency to the browser styling.
    People prefer Normalize, because you don't have to go back and re-style every element.-->

        /*Breakpoints
        We use @media queries to define breakpoints. A breakpoint sets the pixel width at
        which the content will collapse - when your navigation bar will transform in
        some way, and your grid will break into individual elements. Google Developers suggests
        basing breakpoints on content, not specific devices, and people agree.

        You may have heard the phrase mobile first flying around a lot.
        The concept is that you build your content to look great for mobile, and scale up
        from there.
        This is a good philosophy to work with.*/
