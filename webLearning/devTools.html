                <h3>Selecting an Element</h3>
                <p>
                    There are a few ways to see the code for a particular element on the web page. <br />
                    You can... <br /> <br />

                    Click on the TOP LEFT (<b><span class="makeRed">Figure 1, above</span></b>) 'select an element' icon
                    then move the mouse pointer
                    to the element you want on the web page. The code in the elements
                    tab will change to line up with wherever you place your mouse
                    pointer - just click on the element you want to see the code for. <br />
                    <i>If you want to cancel the 'select an element' option just click on figure 1 again.</i> <br /> <br />

                    <b>OR</b> before you open the Development Tools you could RIGHT CLICK
                    on the element you want to see the code of and then choose <b>INSPECT</b>
                    and the Development Tools tab will open at the relevant code you clicked on. <br /> <br />

                    <b>OR</b> you can just look for the code on the elements tab and click on it in there. <br />
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="divBSet">
                <h3>Looking at CSS Code for an Element</h3>
                <p>
                    Use the section on right to see CSS code relating to
                    the element you selected on the left (Elements Tab). <br />
                    You can change the values and see where it sets the
                    values (sometimes) which may give you a good idea as to
                    what is going on. <br />
                    If you need to ADD a new STYLE RULE you can click on the + (see
                    <b><span class="makeRed">Figure 2, above</span></b>) and it will create a new section just below
                    the + (somewhere around <b><span class="makeRed">figure 3, above<span></b>) where you can click it and
                    add your style rule. <br /> <br />
                    <b>NOTE</b> <br />
                    You can also RIGHT CLICK on the elements TAG (eg &lt;p&gt;) and choose
                    the <strong>EDIT AS HTML</strong> from there. <br />
                    This will let you add/change the details of the element (attribute/style etc). <br /> <br />
                    Because this shows the tag in full you could even add a NEW tag above it to see 
                    what it looks like. <br />

                <h3>Changing Text of an Element</h3>
                <p>
                    In order to change the text of an element, first locate the element
                    that holds the text (eg.. the &lt;p&gt; element) and then RIGHT CLICK
                    on the actual text you want to change. <br /> <br />
                    When the popup menu appears select either the <strong>EDIT TEXT</strong>
                    option or the <strong>EDIT AS HTML</strong> option. <br /> <br />

                    <b>NOTE</b> <br />
                    You can also RIGHT CLICK on the elements TAG (eg &lt;p&gt;) and choose
                    the <strong>EDIT AS HTML</strong> from there. <br />
                    You can also add/change an attribute/style this way as well. <br />
