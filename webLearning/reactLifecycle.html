            <p>
                the component lifecycle has three high-level parts:- <br /> <br />

                <b>Mounting</b> <br />
                when the component is being initialized and put into the DOM for the first time. <br /> <br />

                <b>Updating</b> <br />
                when the component updates as a result of changed state or changed props. <br /> <br />

                <b>Unmounting</b> <br />
                when the component is being removed from the DOM. <br /> <br />

                <em>
                    The constructor runs in the <b>Mounting</b> phase. <br />
                    While the render() can run in the <b>mounting</b> and/or the <b>Updating</b> phase. <br />
                </em> <br />

                Therefore it could be best to run some functions, for example the <b>setInterval() function</b>,
                <b>AFTER</b> the render(). <br />

                <em>
                    <b>NOTE</b> <br />
                    For things like <b>setInterval()</b> the <b>render()</b> isn’t a good location. <br />
                    For one, it executes during the mounting phase and the updating phase—too often for us. <br />
                    It’s also generally a bad idea to set up any kind of side-effect like this
                    in render(), as it can create subtle bugs in the future. <br /> <br />

                    the <b>constructor()</b> is also not a great location. <br />
                    It does only execute during the mounting phase, so that’s good, but
                    you should generally avoid side-effects like this in constructors
                    because it violates something called the Single Responsibility Principle. <br />
                    In short, it’s not a constructor’s responsibility to start side-effects.
                </em> <br /> <br />

                During the <b>Mounting Phase</b> there is a FINAL method (after <b>constructor()</b>
                and <b>render()</b>) - it is known as the <b>componentDidMount</b> method. <br />
                <em>
                    This is where you run statements that requires that the
                    component is already placed in the DOM.
                </em><br /> <br />

                During the <b>Unmounting Phase</b> there is a FINAL method - it is
                known as the <b>componentWillUnMount</b> method, <br />
                <em>It runs just BEFORE the class it is in gets removed/cleared.</em> <br /> <br />

                The <b>componentDidUpdate</b> method runs when an update occurs (after a render()). <br />
                <em>This is called after the update has been rendered in the DOM</em><br />

                See w3schools document on
                <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/react/react_lifecycle.asp" target="_blank">
                    React Lifestyle
                </a> <br /> <br />

            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="divBSet divBorder">
            <h2>componentDidMount() method</h2>

            <p>
                This method is called <b>AFTER</b> the render method is completed. <br />
                Which means that, for functions like, for example the <b>setInterval() function</b>,
                it will only start once the render() has been dealt with.<br /> <br />

                <b>A Code Example...</b> <br /> <br />

                <pre>
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

class Clock extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { date: new Date() };
  }

  render() {
    return (
        &lt;div&gt;
                <span class="forceGreen">{this.state.date.toLocaleTimeString()}</span>
        &lt;/div&gt;
  }

                <span class="forceRed"><b>componentDidMount()</b> {</span>
        const oneSecond = 1000;
        setInterval(() =&gt; {
          this.setState({ date: new Date() });
        }, oneSecond);
                <span class="forceRed">}</span>

}

ReactDOM.render(&lt;Clock /&gt;, document.getElementById('app'));
</pre>

                The above example code will just print the TIME on screen using (in render()) <br />
                <b><span class="forceGreen">{this.state.date.toLocaleTimeString()}</span></b> <br /> <br />

                To do this it sets, in <b>the constructor()</b>, the property <b>date</b> <br />
                and as it is set as a <b>this.state.date</b> property then whenever it's value
                changes the screen will get re-rendered. <br /> <br />

                The value of <b>this.state.date</b> changes inside the <span class="forceRed">
                    <b>componentDidMount()</b>
                </span>
                method - it uses <b>this.setState</b> to change the time stored in <b>this.state.date</b>
                every one second. <br /> <br />

        <div class="divBSet divBorder">
            <h2>componentWillUnmount()</h2>

            <p>

                <b>componentWillUnmount()</b>
                is the last function to be called immediately before the component is
                removed from the DOM. <br />
                It is generally used to perform clean-up for any DOM-elements or timers
                created in <b>componentWillMount()</b>. <br /> <br />

                Using this <b>Clock class</b> scenario... <br />
                ...We never told the interval to stop, so it’ll keep running that
                function forever (or at least, until the user leaves/refreshes the page). <br /> <br />

                When the component is unmounted (in other words, removed from the page),
                that timer will keep on ticking, trying to update the state of a
                component that’s effectively gone. <br /> <br />

                This means your users will have some JavaScript code running unnecessarily,
                which will hurt the performance of the app. <br /> <br />

                React will log a warning that looks something like this: <br /> <br />
                <em>
                    <b>Warning:</b> Can't perform a React state update on an unmounted component. <br />
                    This is a no-op, but it indicates a memory leak in your application. <br />
                    To fix, cancel all subscriptions and asynchronous tasks in the
                    componentWillUnmount method.
                </em> <br /> <br />

                If you do not <b>stop the setInterval()</b> then the clock gets mounted
                and unmounted hundreds of times—eventually, this will cause your page to
                become sluggish because of all of the unnecessary work. <br />
                You’ll also see warnings in your browser console. <br />
                Even worse, this can lead to subtle, annoying bugs. <br /> <br />

                <em>
                    components can have lots of other side-effects: <br />
                    loading external data with AJAX, doing manual tweaking of the DOM,
                    setting a global value, and more. <br />
                    We try to limit our side-effects, but it’s difficult to build an interesting
                    app with truly zero side-effects.
                </em> <br /> <br />

                ...JavaScript gives us the <b>clearInterval()</b> function to reset the <b>setInterval()</b>. <br /> <br />

                <b>setInterval()</b> can return an ID, which you can then pass into clearInterval() to clear it. <br /> <br />

                Example... <br />

                <pre>
const oneSecond = 1000;
this.intervalID = setInterval(() =&gt; {
  this.setState({ date: new Date() });
}, oneSecond);
 
// Some time later...
clearInterval(this.intervalID);
</pre>

        </div>
        <div class="divBSet divBorder">
            <h2>ComponentWillUnmount() Example</h2>

import React from 'react';

            <h2>componentWillUpdate()</h2>

            <p>
                The <b>componentDidUpdate</b> method runs when an update occurs (eg
                <b>this.setState()</b> was used) and a render() occurred. <br /> <br />

                Using our clock example (shown to the right) we now have... <br /> <br />

                a function called <b><span class="forceRed">startInterval()</span></b> which
                sets the interval timer
                (<b>setInterval()</b>) and is called from both the <b>componentDidMount()</b> and
                <b>componentDidUpdate()</b> methods. <br />
                <em>This was done so we do not duplicate code</em> <br /> <br />

                <b><span class="forceRed">startInterval()</span></b> checks if the precise time
                is required to be displayed (<b>this.props.isPrecise</b> will be TRUE) and if so
                the interval is set to be 10 times a second. <br />
                If it was FALSE it is set to be once a second. <br /> <br />

                In the <b>render()</b> method it also checks the <b>this.props.isPrecise</b> value and if
                it is TRUE it will display a longer time, with 100th's of a second... <br />
                <b>2021-08-24T12:38:57.546Z</b> <br />
                and if it was FALSE it displays as <br />
                <b>12:38:57 PM</b> <br /> <br />

                Although the <b>render()</b> method displays the time it would not update the value
                as it needs the timer to be set (<b><span class="forceRed">startInterval()</span></b>)
                which tells it to keep updating the time which also makes it re-render the screen. <br /> <br />

                The <b>componentWillMount()</b> method runs when the page first mounts (displays)
                so we have called the <b><span class="forceRed">startInterval()</span></b> function in here. <br />
                <em>That way the interval timer starts the first time the page is displayed.</em> <br /> <br />

                If/when the Clock class is stopped from running then the <b>componentWillUnmount()</b>
                method runs so we had to tell the program to STOP the interval timer running. <br />
                <em><b>clearInterval()</b> stops the interval timer.</em> <br /> <br />

                Finally we have a method called <b>componentDidUpdate</b> which runs whenever the
                <b>render()</b> method runs. <br />
                Here we need to check if the clock has to be re-displayed or not. <br />
                If <b>this.props.isPrecise = TRUE</b> then show the longer time Nd if it was FALSE then
                show the shorter time. <br />
                But because we do not want to redisplay it AND start a new interval timer running we needed
                to check if <b>this.props.isPrecise</b> had been changed. <br />
                If was unchanged then DO NOTHING. <br />
                But if it has changed then we have to start a new interval timer running by calling
                <b><span class="forceRed">startInterval()</span></b> again
                (Note, the <b>componentWillUnmount</b> method will have already stopped the old timer running). <br /> <br />

            <h2>Component Lifestyle Review</h2>

            <p>
                <b>Review</b> <br />
                There are three major phases of a component’s lifecycle:- <br /> <br />

                <b>Mounting</b> <br />
                when the component is being initialized and put into the DOM for the first time. <br />
                The constructor(), render(), and componentDidMount() methods are called during this phase. <br /> <br />

                <b>Updating</b> <br />
                when the component updates as a result of changed state or changed props. <br />
                The render() and componentDidUpdate() are called during this phase. <br /> <br />

                <b>Unmounting</b> <br />
