            <h1>React - An Overview</h1>
            <h2>What is React?</h2>
            <p>
                React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library
                for building user interfaces. <br />
                It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces
                of code called “components”. <br /> <br />

                React has a few different kinds of components, first we'll go with
                <b>React.Component</b> <br /> <br />
                <br /> <br />

                You can find an MDN Tutorial Document on React
                <a href="https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html" target="_blank">Here</a>
                that may be useful. <br /> <br />

                <em>Extracts from this are used below...</em><br /> <br />

                You can also take a look at w3Schools offering and follow their
                <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/react/default.asp" target="_blank">
                    React Tutorial</a> (also listed in next pane, Set-up Environment)<br /> <br />

                <hr /> <br />

                To create a REACT/NODE.JS set-up using 
                <b>Visual Studio 2019</b> take a look at the
                <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/javascript/tutorial-nodejs-with-react-and-jsx?view=vs-2019" 
                   target="_blank">Microsoft Document</a>. <br /> <br /> <br />

                <b>NOTE</b> <br />
                When following this document to create a Project in Visual Studio 2019, and 
                installing the <b>NPM Packages</b> it says you can also just add/create the 
                list of dependencies in to the <b>package.json</b> file. <br /> <br />

                The dependencies to add are as follows (you can cut & paste it in):-

                <pre>
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.17.1",
    "path": "^0.12.7",
    "react": "^17.0.2",
    "react-dom": "^17.0.2",
    "ts-loader": "^9.2.5",
    "typescript": "^4.3.5",
    "webpack": "^5.51.1",
    "webpack-cli": "^4.8.0"
  }
</pre>

                So a <b>package.json</b> file may look like this... <br /> <br />
                
                                                                           <pre>

  "name": "jamming",
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "description": "Jamming",
  "main": "server.js",
  "author": {
    "name": ""
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.17.1",
    "path": "^0.12.7",
    "react": "^17.0.2",
    "react-dom": "^17.0.2",
    "ts-loader": "^9.2.5",
    "typescript": "^4.3.5",
    "webpack": "^5.51.1",
    "webpack-cli": "^4.8.0"
  }
}

</pre>
                <em>The name of the project that this was taken from was called <b>Jamming</b></em> <br /> <br />

            <h2>Set-up Environment</h2>

            <p>
                In order to learn and test React, you should set up a React Environment on your computer. <br />
                The create-react-app is an officially supported way to create React applications. <br /> <br />

                If you have NPM and Node.js installed, you can create a React application by first
                installing the create-react-app. <br /> <br />

                Install create-react-app by running this command in your terminal: <br /> <br />

                <b>D:\<em>YourDirectoryToWorkFrom</em> npm install -g create-react-app</b> <br /> <br />

                When done you can create a React application (named myTestReact)... <br /> <br />

                <b>D:\<em>YourDirectoryToWorkFrom</em> npx create-react-app mytestreact</b> <br />
                <em>It does not like CAPITAL letters in the name (mytestreact NOT MyTestReact).</em><br /> <br />

                Then you can log into the folder <b>mytestreact</b> <br />
                <b>cd mytestreact</b> <br /> <br />

                Then to start the React application for your <b>mytestreact</b> do this... <br /> <br />

                <b>D:\<em>YourDirectoryToWorkFrom</em> npm start</b> <br />
                <em>It will open a tab in your browser (it may take a moment)</em> <br /> <br />

                <img src="Images/react.jpg" alt="screen image" width="220" height="200" /> <br /> <br />

                The above will result in a new directory inside your chosen directory, eg... <br />
                <b>D:\<em>YourDirectoryToWorkFrom</em>\mytestreact\src</b> <br /> <br />

                I created this in my <b>d:\ReactDirectories\CreateReactApp</b> directory. <br /> <br />

    <div class="divFlex">
        <div class="divBorder divBSet">
            <h2>subclasses:</h2>

            <p>
                <em>
                    We use components to tell React what we want to see on the screen. <br />
                    When our data changes, React will efficiently update and re-render our components.
                </em> <br /> <br />

                Here is an example to start with... <br /> <br />

                <pre>
class ShoppingList extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      &lt;div className="shopping-list"&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;Shopping List for {this.props.name}&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Instagram&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;WhatsApp&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Oculus&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    );
  }
}

// Example usage: &lt;ShoppingList name="Mark" /&gt;
</pre>

                Here, ShoppingList is a React component class, or React component type. <br />
                A component takes in parameters, called <b>props</b> (short for “properties”),
                and returns a hierarchy of views to display via the render method. <br /> <br />

                The render method returns a description of what you want to see on the screen. <br />
                React takes the description and displays the result. <br />
                In particular, render returns a React element, which is a
                lightweight description of what to render. <br />
                Most React developers use a special syntax called <b>"JSX"</b> which makes these
                structures easier to write. <br />
                The <b>&lt;div&gt;</b> syntax is transformed at build time to
                <b>React.createElement('div')</b>. <br /> <br />

                The example above is equivalent to (the non JSX version) of: <br /> <br />

                <pre>
return React.createElement(
        'div', 
        {className: 'shopping-list'},
    React.createElement('h1', /* ... h1 children ... */),
    React.createElement('ul', /* ... ul children ... */)
);
</pre>

                JSX comes with the full power of JavaScript. <br />
                You can put any JavaScript expressions within braces inside JSX. <br />
                Each React element is a JavaScript object that you can store in a variable
                or pass around in your program. <br /> <br />

                The ShoppingList component above only renders built-in DOM components
                like <b>
                    &lt;div&gt;, &lt;ul&gt; and &lt;li&gt;
                </b>. <br />
                But you can compose and render custom React components too. <br />
                For example, we can now refer to the whole shopping list by
                writing &lt;ShoppingList&gt;. <br />
                Each React component is encapsulated and can operate independently;
                this allows you to build complex UIs from simple components. <br /> <br />

                Create React App is a comfortable environment for learning React,
                and is the best way to start building a new single-page
                application in React. <br /> <br />

                It sets up your development environment so that you can use the
                latest JavaScript features, provides a nice developer experience,
                and optimizes your app for production. <br />
                You’ll need to have Node >= 10.16 and npm >= 5.6 on your machine. <br /> <br />

                To create a project, run (in Windows Command Prompt): <br /> <br />

                First log into the directory you want to use <br />
                The below will create a new directory there called <b>my-app</b> <br /> <br />

                <b>npx create-react-app my-app <br /> </b>
                <em>Say 'y' to install - it may take a few minutes</em> <br />
                <b>

                <em>Some commands to use from the command propmpt:- <br /> <br />

                <b>npm start</b> <br />
                Starts the development server. <br /> <br />

                <b>npm run build</b> <br />
                Bundles the app into static files for production <br /> <br />

                <b>npm test</b> <br />
                Starts the test runner. <br /> <br />


                <b>run eject</b> <br />
                Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files

            <h2>Adding a constructor</h2>

            <p>
                As a next step, we want the Square component to “remember” that it got clicked,
                and fill it with an “X” mark. <br />
                To “remember” things, <b>components use state</b>. <br /> <br />

                See w3Schools comments on
                <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/react/react_state.asp"
                   target="_blank">state</a> <br /> <br />

                React components has a built-in state object. <br />
                The state object is where you store property values that belongs to the component. <br />
                When the state object changes, the component re-renders. <br />
                The state object is initialized in the constructor. <br />
                The state object can contain as many properties as you like, eg... <br />
                <b>
                    this.state = { <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brand: "Ford", <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;model: "Mustang", <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;colour: "Red" <br />
                    };
                </b> <br /> <br />


                Let’s store the current value of the Square in <b>this.state</b>, and
                change it when the Square is clicked. <br /> <br />

                First we need to add a constructor to the class to initialize the state: <br /> <br />

                <pre>
class Square extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      sqPos: null,
    };
  }

  render() {
    return (
                <b>&lt;button className="square" 
            onClick={() => { alert('click'); }}&gt;</b>
        {this.props.sqPos}
      &lt;/button&gt;
    );
  }
}
</pre>
                <em>
                    <b>Note</b>...Setting <b>sqPos: null</b> in the constructor will
                    make all the squares display NULL (blank)...<br />
                    if I still wanted the numbers displayed then I could make it...<br />
                    <b>
                        this.state = { <br />
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sqPos: this.props.sqPos <br />
                        };
                    </b> <br />
                    because in the class 'board' (in a different pane above) I have set
                    a value for sqPos...later, though, it will change so this.props.sqPos
                    will no longer work.
                </em> <br /> <br />

                <b>Note</b>...In JavaScript classes, you need to always call <b>super</b> when
                defining the constructor of a subclass. <br />
                All React component classes that have a constructor should
                start with a <b>super(props)</b> call. <br /> <br />

                <b>Props</b> are arguments passed into React Components. <br />
                See w3Schools page regarding
                <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/react/react_props.asp"
                   target="_blank">React Props</a>. <br /> <br />

                <h3>See next pane to continue...</h3>

            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="divBSet divBorder">

            <h2>Continued...</h2>
            <p>
                After setting up the constructor to set the <b>sqPos</b> value to null
                we then need to change the render method to change the value when
                the button is clicked. <br />
                For now I will change it to show an 'X' in the square that was clicked on. <br /> <br />

                To do this the onClick function (in the 'class square's render section)
                needs to be changed to read... <br /> <br />

                <pre>
class Square extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      sqPos: null,
    };
  }

<b>render() {
    return (
      &lt;button
        className="square"
        onClick={() => this.setState({sqPos: 'X'})}
      &gt;
        {this.state.sqPos}
      &lt;/button&gt;
    );
  } </b>
}
</pre>
                The <b>this.setState()</b> method is used to change a properties
                value held in <b>this.state</b> <br /> <br />

                When a value in the <b>state</b> object changes, the component will re-render,
                meaning that the output will change according to the new value(s). <br /> <br />

                Therefore, when we click on a square we are changing the value from NULL to X <br />
                The component will then re-render and change the output. <br /> <br />

            <h2>Lifting State Up (pt 1)</h2>

            <p>
                Next, to have a complete game, we now need to alternate placing “X”s
                and “O”s on the board, and we need a way to determine a winner. <br /> <br />

                Currently, each Square component maintains the game’s state. <br />
                To check for a winner, we’ll maintain the value of each
                of the 9 squares in one location. <br /> <br />

                We may think that Board should just ask each Square for the Square’s state. <br />
                Although this approach is possible in React, we discourage it because the
                code becomes difficult to understand, susceptible to bugs, and hard to refactor. <br />
                Instead, the best approach is to store the game’s state in the parent Board
                component instead of in each Square. <br />
                The Board component can tell each Square what to display by
                passing a prop, just like we did when we passed a number to each Square. <br /> <br />

                <b>
                    To collect data from multiple children, or to have two child components
                    communicate with each other, you need to declare the shared state
                    in their parent component instead. <br />
                    The parent component can pass the state back down to the children by
                    using props; this keeps the child components in sync with each
                    other and with the parent component.
                </b> <br /> <br />

            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="divBSet divBorder">
            <h2>Lifting State Up (pt 2)</h2>

            <p>
                We need to add a constructor to the parent (board class) and tell
                it we need a property (called <b>squares</b> which will hold an
                array of 9 items (as the board is 9 squares). <br />
                We will Null fill it as we want to start with a blank board. <br /> <br />

                <pre>
class Board extends React.Component {
                <b>constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      squares: Array().fill(null),
    };
  }</b>
  renderSquare(i) {
    return &lt;Square sqPos={i} /&gt;;
  }

  render() {
    ...more code continues here..
</pre>

                As we start to play the game the array, referred to as <b>this.state.squares</b>,
                could look like, for example... <br />
                <b>"O", null, "X", "X", "X", "O", "O", null, null</b> <br /> <br />
                it makes better sense to picture it more like... <br />
                <b>
                    "O", null, "X" <br />
                    "X", "X", "O" <br />
                    "O", null, null
                </b> <br /> <br />

                As a Tic Tac Toe board is a 3 x 3 square. <br /> <br />


            </p>

    <a href="#">Top</a> <br />

    <div class="divFlex">
        <div class="divBSet divBorder">
            <h2>Lifting State Up (pt 3)</h2>

            <p>
                And then we have to change the <b>renderSquare</b> method
                to use the array, as in... <br /> <br />

                <b>
                    renderSquare(i) { <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return &lt;Square sqPos={this.state.squares[i]} /&gt; <br>
                    }
                </b> <br /> <br />

                Next, we need to change what happens when a Square is clicked. <br />
                The Board component now maintains which squares are filled. <br />
                We need to create a way for the Square to update the Board’s state. <br />
                Since state is considered to be private to the component that
                defines it, we cannot update the Board’s state directly from Square. <br /> <br />

                Instead, we’ll pass down a function from the Board to the Square, and
                we’ll have Square call that function when a square is clicked. <br /> <br />

                We’ll change the renderSquare method in Board to do this first... <br /> <br />

                <b>
                    renderSquare(i) { <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return ( <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;Square <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sqPos={this.state.squares[i]} <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;onClick={() => this.handleClick(i)} <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/&gt; <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;); <br />
                    }
                </b> <br /> <br />

                So it will set the value of sqPos to be the current state of <b>this.state.squares[i]</b> <br />
                then it will pass down the function that will get called when a square is clicked. <br /> <br />

                <b>NOTE...</b> <br />
                Now we’re passing down two <b>props</b> from Board to Square: sqPos and onClick. <br />
                The onClick prop is a function that Square can call when clicked. <br /> <br />

                The actual function (<b>handleClick</b>) needs to be created inside 
                Board, below the constructor, and will look like this... <br /> <br />

                <b>
                    handleClick(i) {<br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;const squares = this.state.squares.slice(); <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;squares[i] = 'X'; <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this.setState({squares: squares}); <br />
                    } <br /> <br />
                </b>
                <em>...the function creates a variable called squares and sets it's 
                value to be equal to the array "this.state.squares" - not sure if I  
                need the <b>.slice()</b> but the lesson wants it. <br />
                ...It then sets the relevant array item in the local squares variable to 'X'. <br />
                ...Then sets the squares property in this.state</em>

                And because now we do not want Square to keep track of the game's state (it's to be 
                handled in Board instead)
                the <b>constructor in Square</b> is no longer needed...and we should render 
                the values by using <b>this.props.sqPos</b> instead of this.state.sqPos <br />
                As well as passing it the function from Boards. <br /> <br />

            <p>
                The code so far looks like this... <br /> <br />

            <pre>
class Square extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
        &lt;button className="square"

        {this.props.sqPos}
        &lt;/button&gt;
    );
  }
}

class Board extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {

    };
  }

  handleClick(i) {

    squares[i] = 'X';

  renderSquare(i) {

  }

  render() {

</pre>
            <br />
            <b>Note...</b> <br />
            in handleClick, we call <b>.slice()</b> to create a copy of the squares array to 
                modify instead of modifying the existing array. <br />
            <em>.slice() without any start/end values (eg .slice(0, 3)) means it will copy 
                everything...(0,3) means it will copy 3 items starting at

            <h2>Function Components</h2>

            <p>
                In React, <b>function components</b> are a simpler way to write components 
                that only contain a render method and don’t have their own state. <br />
                Instead of defining a class which extends React.Component, we can write a 
                function that takes props as input and returns what should be rendered. <br />
                Function components are less tedious to write than classes, and many 
                components can be expressed this way. <br /> <br />

                So we can replace the Square class with this Square function... <br /> <br />

                <b>function Square(props) { <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return ( <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;button <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;className="square" <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;onClick={props.onClick}&gt; <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{props.sqPos} <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/button&gt; <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;); <br />
                }      
                </b> <br /> <br />

                <em><b>Note</b> As <b>props</b> is now a parameter of the function we 
                do not refer to it as <b>this.props</b>. Instead we would be passing 
                <b>this.props</b> when we call the function.</em> <br /> <br />

            </p>

        </div>

        <div class="divBSet divBorder">
            <h2>Player - X or O</h2>

            <p>So far we are always putting "X" on the board when a square is clicked. <br />
            So we need to add code to alternate between "X" and "O" to allow for 2 players. <br /> <br />
            
            To do this we are going to add a new property (<b>xIsNext</b>)) to the Board set up <br />
            So inside the Board Class where it sets the <b>state</b> we need it to look like... <br />
            <b>this.state = { <br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;squares: Array(9).fill(null), <br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;xIsNext: true, <br />
            };</b> <br /> <br />

            And then in the <b>handleClick()</b> function (still in the Board class) we need to 
            check the new property (xIsNext) to see if we need to display "X" or "O". <br />
            Then change the value of <b>xIsNext</b> so the next click will display correctly. <br /> <br />

            <b>
                handleClick(i) { <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;const squares = this.state.squares.slice(); <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;squares[i] = this.state.xIsNext ? 'X' : 'O'; <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this.setState({ <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;squares: squares, <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;xIsNext: !this.state.xIsNext, <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}); <br />
                } </b> <br /> <br />

            <em>The line of code <b>xIsNext: !this.state.xIsNext</b> will change the value of 
                xIsNext to be <b>true</b> if it is <b>false</b> and vice-versa.</em> <br /> <br />
